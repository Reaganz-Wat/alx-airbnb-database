# üìò SQL Joins Practice: Bookings System

This project demonstrates the use of different types of SQL joins ‚Äî `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN` ‚Äî using a hypothetical booking system. The goal is to write and understand complex SQL queries that accurately reflect real-world relationships between users, properties, bookings, and reviews.

---

## üß† Objective

Master SQL joins and subqueries by writing and testing queries across related tables in a normalized relational database.

---

## üìÅ Tables Used

This project uses the following tables from the database schema:

- `users`
- `properties`
- `bookings`
- `reviews`

---

## üß™ SQL Join Queries

### 1. üîó INNER JOIN: Bookings and Users

```sql
-- 1. INNER JOIN: Get bookings and the users who made them
SELECT * 
FROM users AS u 
INNER JOIN bookings AS b ON u.user_id = b.user_id;
```

üìå **Purpose:**  
Retrieves all bookings that are linked to a user. Only users who have made at least one booking will appear in the result.

---

### 2. üß© LEFT JOIN: Properties and Their Reviews

```sql
-- 2. LEFT JOIN: Get all properties and their reviews (even if no review)
SELECT * 
FROM properties 
LEFT JOIN reviews ON properties.property_id = reviews.property_id 
ORDER BY properties.property_id;
```

üìå **Purpose:**  
Retrieves all properties, including those that have no reviews. If a property has no review, the review-related fields will be `NULL`.

---

### 3. üåê FULL OUTER JOIN: Users and Bookings

```sql
-- 3. FULL OUTER JOIN: Get all users and bookings (even if not linked)
SELECT * 
FROM users 
FULL OUTER JOIN bookings ON users.user_id = bookings.user_id;
```

üìå **Purpose:**  
Retrieves all users and all bookings ‚Äî including:
- Users who haven‚Äôt made any bookings
- Bookings not linked to any user (if such cases exist)

üìå **Note:**  
If you're using MySQL or MariaDB, you must emulate `FULL OUTER JOIN` as it's not supported natively:

```sql
-- Simulated FULL OUTER JOIN in MySQL/MariaDB
SELECT * 
FROM users 
LEFT JOIN bookings ON users.user_id = bookings.user_id

UNION

SELECT * 
FROM users 
RIGHT JOIN bookings ON users.user_id = bookings.user_id;
```

---

## üîé Subquery Examples

### 4. üìà Subquery: Properties with Average Rating > 4.0

```sql
-- This is a SQL script that demonstrates the use of subqueries to filter properties based on average ratings from reviews.
SELECT
    *
FROM
    properties
WHERE
    property_id IN (
        SELECT
            property_id
        FROM
            reviews
        GROUP BY
            property_id
        HAVING
            AVG(rating) > 4.0
    );
```

üìå **Purpose:**  
Selects all properties whose average review rating is greater than 4.0. This uses a non-correlated subquery.

---

### 5. üßë‚Äçüíº Subquery with JOIN: Users Who Booked More Than Once

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    users
    RIGHT JOIN (
        SELECT
            user_id,
            COUNT(*) AS booking_times
        FROM
            bookings
        GROUP BY
            user_id
        HAVING
            COUNT(*) > 1
    ) AS tb ON users.user_id = tb.user_id;
```

üìå **Purpose:**  
This query finds users who have made more than one booking by aggregating bookings and then joining the result with the users table to retrieve user information.

---

### 6. üìä INNER JOIN with Aggregation: Users and Booking Counts

```sql
SELECT
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    u.phone_number,
    u.role,
    u.created_at,
    b.book_count
FROM
    users AS u
    INNER JOIN (
        SELECT
            user_id,
            COUNT(*) AS book_count
        FROM
            bookings
        GROUP BY
            user_id
    ) AS b ON u.user_id = b.user_id;
```

üìå **Purpose:**  
Retrieves user details along with the total number of bookings each user has made. Only users with at least one booking are included.

---

### 7. üè† Window Function: Ranking Properties by Booking Volume

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    properties AS p
    INNER JOIN (
        SELECT
            property_id,
            booking_count,
            RANK() OVER (
                ORDER BY
                    booking_count DESC
            ) AS booking_rank
        FROM
            (
                SELECT
                    property_id,
                    COUNT(*) AS booking_count
                FROM
                    bookings
                GROUP BY
                    property_id
            ) AS booking_summary
    ) AS r ON p.property_id = r.property_id;
```

### 8. üßÆ Window Function: Using ROW_NUMBER to Rank Properties

```sql
SELECT
    property_id,
    booking_count,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        ORDER BY booking_count DESC
    ) AS booking_position
FROM (
    SELECT
        property_id,
        COUNT(*) AS booking_count
    FROM bookings
    GROUP BY property_id
) AS booking_summary;
```

üìå **Purpose:**  
Ranks properties based on how many bookings they have received using the `RANK()` window function. Tied properties will receive the same rank, and ranks will skip accordingly.
